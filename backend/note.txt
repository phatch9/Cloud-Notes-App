 => ERROR [backend builder 7/7] RUN go build -o server ./cmd/api

--Fix this error when running `docker compose build --no-cache`

- the error because: go.sum is still empty inside the Docker build.
- When Docker runs go mod download + go mod tidy, 
- it does not yet know about the Fiber + pgx dependencies, because developer never added them locally first.

Run these commands in /backend directory on host machine  (not in Docker):

cd backend

# Add Fiber
go get github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2

# Add pgx postgres driver
go get github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool

# Clean up dependencies
go mod tidy

Now can see go.sum populated with lots of lines (hashes of deps)


# ERROR:
cloud-notes-app-backend-1 | 
2025/09/04 03:13:56 db connection failed: failed to connect to user=notes database=notes: hostname resolving error: 
lookup db on 127.0.0.11:53: no such host

Solved:
updated docker-compose.yml
- Ensure both backend and db are on the same Docker network
networks:
```
cloudnotes-net:
    driver: bridge

services:
  db:
    ...
    networks:
      - cloudnotes-net

  backend:
    ...
    networks:
      - cloudnotes-net
```
Re-run:
- After checking these, run:

docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build

- Then check backend logs:

docker logs -f cloud-notes-app-backend-1
