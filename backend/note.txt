 => ERROR [backend builder 7/7] RUN go build -o server ./cmd/api

--Fix this error when running `docker compose build --no-cache`

- the error because: go.sum is still empty inside the Docker build.
- When Docker runs go mod download + go mod tidy, 
- it does not yet know about the Fiber + pgx dependencies, because developer never added them locally first.

Run these commands in /backend directory on host machine  (not in Docker):

cd backend

# Add Fiber
go get github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2

# Add pgx postgres driver
go get github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool

# Clean up dependencies
go mod tidy

Now can see go.sum populated with lots of lines (hashes of deps)
